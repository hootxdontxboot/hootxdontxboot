## 💼 Current Role

**Software Engineering Co-op**  
📍 *Golisano Institute for Sustainability (GIS), RIT*  
🔧 Working on advanced **remanufacturing automation systems** that combine **machine learning** and **collaborative robotics** to:
- Categorize and sort used automotive parts
- Optimize robot calibration and throughput efficiency
- Build dynamic UI and TTS systems for public-facing robotics demos (like Robbie the robot signing names!)

Highlights:
- Reduced processing time by **84%** (25s → 4s) using multithreading and model optimization
- Cut robot calibration setup time from **6 hours to 5 minutes**
- Created a full-day robot experience for 1,500+ event visitors

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I once built a robot that signed over **600 names** in a single day—and yes, it used G-Code scaling, threaded UI handling, and a custom marker end-effector. 🤖🖊️

I had **zero coding experience** before college. My love for engineering started with:
- CNC machining
- Laser cutting
- AutoCAD projects
